Having grown up in Calgary, the winds took her eastward to study at Concordia University where she completed her BFA in Studio Arts in 2018. Since then, she has put down roots here and tends to her practice between home and her studio space in Chabanel. With her artistic inclinations and aesthetic approaches now at a pivotal stage in their development, she plans on furthering education at the Master’s level in Studio Arts with a concentration in drawing and painting.\n\nThe project _Cassandraopeia_ birthed into existence in late 2025 after years and years of dedicated self-directed research, forethought, and anticipation. Majorly a space for Cassandra’s personal visual arts practice, it aims to eventually branch out and embrace correlated creative trajectories in music and esoteric offerings, along with recommended learning resources on pertinent fields of interest. _Cassandraopeia_ intends to be an access point of intrinsic healing and world-building, interweaving nuances of emotionality, psychology, and spirituality into a nest-like poetic space. Through her ever-growing creative practice, Cassandra bridges influences drawn from the vital natural world and the vast celestial realms into one of an affinity for clear sattvic guiding principles.\n\nIn addition to her expertise in the visual arts, Cassandra also has strong knowledge of and dedicated passion for herbalism, astrology, tarot, crystal healing, symbolism, and dreams. Her highly developed sensitivity and intuition guides her to learn of various analogous esoteric specialties throughout life. Some she takes keen interest in are breathwork, somatics, yoga, meditation, reiki, and sound healing. Other activities she enjoys thoroughly are hiking, cycling, alpine skiing, singing, reading, playing the piano, and pressing flowers. Every one of these fascinations speaks directly to her artistic practice, shaping the lens through which she sees the world and distills her understanding of reality through creation.\n\n## Artist statement\n\nMoved by magic realism, nuance, energy, symbolism, interconnectivity, and spirituality, I aim to offer visionary windows into a spatial awareness of these guiding intimations. I shape creative impulses into a personal devotion to life as art, art as life, and offer my innermost reflections upon existence through drawing and painting. By receiving impressions drawn through the senses from natural and esoteric sources, I act as a channel for what sensitive essences come through. I carefully observe, touch, hold, listen, sense, witness, intuit, divine, and glean. From this ritualized way of being my visions emerge, manifest, and realize their destinies, interweaving symbols, colours, patterns, and contrasts together in harmonized unity.\n\nMy practice takes root in a rich inner landscape forged in honour of light, shadow, all that is celestial, the natural world, as well as the timeless elements. Feelings, insights, and perspectives belonging to sibylline dreams highlight notions of the vital, the mystical, and the transcendental. These meditations in turn become the slate upon which I endeavour to approach the keystone of consciousness and distill subtleties of contemplation into intricate creative methods. By being a medium of flow through art, I connect instinctively and imaginatively with core psychic processes and attune to creation as a personal alignment to the familiar unknown. I aim to calibrate the aesthetic edge of definition and indefiniteness, of formlessness and form, in my own circling of lifelong existential inquiries made visible.\n\nI create to surface nearer and dive deeper, to journey beyond and come back home, as a means to evoke the many mysteries of being.\n\n## CV\n\nCASSANDRA TANKÓ\n\nEmail: cassandratanko@gmail.com\nPortfolio / Website: www.cassandraopeia.com\n\nBorn in Budapest, Hungary\nLives and works in Tiohtià:ke / Mooniyang / Montréal, Canada\n\nEducation\n2018 — Bachelor of Fine Arts with Distinction – Concordia University, Montréal (QC)\n\nComplementary Education\n2022 — Certification in Usui Reiki - Level I with Master Kimberley Buckler – Cochrane (AB)\n2020 — Introduction to Creative Arts Therapies – Concordia University, Montréal (QC)\n\nComplementary Work\n2025 — Founder and Project Manager of Cassandraopeia – Montréal (QC)\n2021-22 — Intuitive Tarot and Crystal Medium – Amaryllis Crystal Portal, Cochrane (AB)\n\nResidencies\n2024 — Artist’s Residency – Domaine des Lignes, Woburn (QC)\n\nGroup Exhibitions / Installations\n2026 — Earth Tones [Forthcoming Relaunch] – Montréal (QC)\n2024 — Earth Tones: Virtual Museum and In-person Exhibition – Montréal (QC)\n2017 — Transience/Permanence – Concordia University - VA Building, Montréal (QC)\n2017 — grasp – Galerie POP Gallery, Montréal (QC)\n\nSolo Exhibitions / Installations\n2025 — Incantations of Blue – Domaine des Lignes, Woburn (QC)\n\nNotable Custom Projects\n2025 — Commission – Personalized artwork and design for Ashton Passchier, RMT\n2023 — Commission – Personalized artwork and design for sae Pottery\n2021 — Commission – Personalized artwork for Alexia Avina’s In The Pantheon of Decay","src/content/page/About.mdx","6be0ebf2a67703fc","About.mdx",true,"contact",{"id":21,"data":23,"body":26,"filePath":27,"digest":28,"legacyId":29,"deferredRender":20},{"title":24,"description":25},"Contact","Contact Cassandra Tanko, visual artist","For all art inquiries: \u003Cbr/>\nart@cassandraopeia.com\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n⋆ ◌° .  ོ ⋆ 𓇢\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n☽ Cassandra Tankó (she/they) \u003Cbr/>\n﹏  Tiohtià:ke / Mooniyang / Montréal","src/content/page/Contact.mdx","5bc16b39af3741d4","Contact.mdx","drawings",{"id":30,"data":32,"filePath":43,"digest":44,"legacyId":45,"deferredRender":20},{"title":33,"description":34,"selected_artworks":35},"Drawings","Drawings by Cassandra Tankó",[36,39,41],{"id":37,"collection":38},"sea","art",{"id":40,"collection":38},"suspended",{"id":42,"collection":38},"the-day-the-sky-opened","src/content/page/Drawings.mdx","4011aed02d765511","Drawings.mdx","home",{"id":46,"data":48,"body":74,"filePath":75,"digest":76,"legacyId":77,"deferredRender":20},{"title":49,"description":50,"featured_image":51,"selected_artworks":52},"Cassandra Tankó","Interdisciplinary project founded and run by visual artist Cassandra Tankó.",{"id":40,"collection":38},[53,55,57,59,60,62,64,66,68,70,72],{"id":54,"collection":38},"reflecting-eclipse",{"id":56,"collection":38},"submerged",{"id":58,"collection":38},"void-sealed",{"id":40,"collection":38},{"id":61,"collection":38},"my-wish-for-you",{"id":63,"collection":38},"rebirth",{"id":65,"collection":38},"flower-meditation-quartz",{"id":67,"collection":38},"magic-clover",{"id":69,"collection":38},"being-here",{"id":71,"collection":38},"birthing-seed",{"id":73,"collection":38},"dying-glint","## Selected artworks","src/content/page/Home.mdx","57f0b9af130426fc","Home.mdx","paintings",{"id":78,"data":80,"body":95,"filePath":96,"digest":97,"legacyId":98,"deferredRender":20},{"title":81,"description":82,"selected_artworks":83,"tag":78,"collection":38},"Paintings","Paintings by Cassandra Tankó",[84,85,86,87,88,89,90,92,93,94],{"id":63,"collection":38},{"id":65,"collection":38},{"id":67,"collection":38},{"id":54,"collection":38},{"id":71,"collection":38},{"id":73,"collection":38},{"id":91,"collection":38},"fluidly-in-the-water",{"id":61,"collection":38},{"id":56,"collection":38},{"id":58,"collection":38},"import Slider from '../../components/Slider.astro';","src/content/page/Paintings.mdx","5ed09013a9892c5f","Paintings.mdx",["Map",69,100,71,113,73,127,65,138,91,152,67,163,61,175,63,186,54,197,56,208,40,219,232,233,42,241,58,252],{"id":69,"data":101,"filePath":108,"assetImports":109,"digest":111,"legacyId":112,"deferredRender":20},{"title":102,"date":103,"imagePath":104,"altText":105,"tags":106,"medium":107},"Being Here","2021","__ASTRO_IMAGE_./paintings/being here.jpg","Being Here.
